Python Blog Title Scraper
A simple and adaptable Python script that scrapes all blog post titles from the main page of a target website. This script uses the requests library to fetch web content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information.

Features
Fetches Live Web Content: Sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, mimicking a web browser.

Parses HTML: Uses BeautifulSoup to navigate the complex structure of a webpage's HTML.

Extracts Specific Data: Identifies and extracts the text from elements containing blog post titles.

Customizable: Easily adaptable to scrape different websites by changing the URL and the HTML selectors.

Robust Error Handling: Includes try...except blocks to manage potential network errors or issues with the website's response.

User-Friendly Output: Prints a clean, numbered list of all the titles found.

How to Use
1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Installation
Clone this repository or download the scraper.py script to your local machine. You will need to install two Python libraries, requests and beautifulsoup4. You can install them using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

3. Execution
To run the script, simply execute it from your terminal. By default, it is configured to scrape titles from https://www.wired.com/most-recent/.

python scraper.py

Upon successful execution, the script will print a numbered list of the blog post titles it found on the page.

Customization
Web scraping often requires tailoring the script to the specific HTML structure of the target website. If you want to scrape a different blog, you will likely need to make the following changes:

Update the Target URL: In the main function, change the target_url variable to the URL of the website you wish to scrape.

# In the main() function of scraper.py
target_url = "[https://www.example-blog.com/](https://www.example-blog.com/)"

Inspect the Website's HTML:

Go to the target website in your browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

Right-click on one of the blog post titles you want to scrape and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".

This will open the developer tools and show you the HTML code. Identify the tag (e.g., <h2>, <h3>, <a>) and any unique attributes (like class or id) that are common to all the blog post titles.

Update the Selector in the Script:

In the scrape_blog_titles function, modify the part of the code that finds the title elements. The current script is tailored for a specific attribute (data-event-click). You will need to change this to match the structure you found in the previous step.

For example, if titles are in <h3> tags with a class of post-title, you would change the find logic to something like this:

# Example modification for a different site structure
title_elements = soup.find_all('h3', class_='post-title')
